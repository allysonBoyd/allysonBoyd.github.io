It's determined by what you make of your expeirinces as a human being." And even thoughy Claire peacfully pased she is still living in our hearts. She was an amazing beautiful soul!

                <p><em>"I’ve been sick and dying my entire life.  And yet, I am so proud of my life.  What does that say?  We’re waiting to be healthy; we’re waiting to be wealthy; we’re waiting to find our passion; we’re waiting to find our true love before we actually start living!  Instead of looking at everything that we have—looking at all of the pain, looking at all of the sadness, looking at all of the beauty, and making something with that.  That’s how innovation happens.”</em></p>
